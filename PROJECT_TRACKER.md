# Project Tracker

Last updated: 2026-07-03

This file is the working tracker for MVP progress. Use it with
`docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/mvp-release-checklist.md`, and
`docs/mvp-release-notes.md`: the docs describe product/release contracts; this
file tracks execution state across task batches.

## Current Status

- MVP feature scope: implemented.
- Current workstream: internal macOS MVP release-candidate hardening.
- Branch: `main`.
- Push status: report in the final response for each completed batch.
- Release target: unsigned universal macOS app plus DMG for internal
  validation.

## In Flight

Current batch: none.

Last completed batch:

- Ran `npm run smoke:release` against the current branch.
- Added `docs/mvp-manual-qa-template.md` for release candidate result capture.
- Added `docs/mvp-first-run-walkthrough.md` for reviewer first-run validation.
- Added `docs/cli-quickstart.md` for the end-to-end CLI setup and generation
  flow.

Verification status:

- `npm run check:mvp-docs`: passed.
- `npm run smoke:release`: passed.

## Release Gates

Required before sharing an internal MVP candidate:

- `npm run check:all`
- `npm run smoke:mvp`
- `npm run smoke:release`

Useful targeted checks:

- `cargo test -p c4lens-cli --test init`
- `cargo test -p c4lens-cli --test doctor`
- `npm run check:release-metadata`
- `npm run check:mvp-docs`
- `npm run package:verify`

## Next Candidate Tasks

Pick from this list when the user asks for the next MVP task batch:

- Add packaged artifact retention/version notes to release docs if CI output
  proves ambiguous.
- Resolve issues found by the first internal manual QA pass.
- Decide whether the internal MVP candidate needs a signed/notarized follow-up
  before wider sharing.

## Known Non-Blocking MVP Limits

- No rendered L4 code-level views.
- No LSP-backed relationship inference.
- No generated-slug rename or move preservation.
- No multi-repo workspace.
- No local agent API.
- No signed/notarized installer.
- No auto-updater.

## Tracker Rules

- Update this file at the start or end of every MVP task batch.
- Keep `In Flight` accurate before a commit.
- Move completed batch details into `Recent Batches` after commit.
- Keep roadmap feature status in `docs/roadmap.md`; use this file for execution
  status and next-batch selection.
